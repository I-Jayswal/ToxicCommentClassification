# Toxic Comment Detection and Classification

## Overview

This project addresses the pervasive issue of toxic behavior in online discussions by developing a deep learning model capable of automatically detecting and classifying toxic comments. 
Toxic behavior, including hate speech, insults, and threats, poses significant challenges to fostering respectful and safe online environments. 
By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning algorithms, this project aims to mitigate these challenges by accurately identifying and categorizing toxic comments.


## Background

Online platforms often suffer from toxic behavior that can harm individuals and communities. 
This project aims to create a tool that can help moderators and automated systems detect and manage toxic comments, improving the overall quality of online interactions.

## Features

- **Toxic Comment Detection**: Identify comments that are toxic, including hate speech, insults, and threats.
- **Classification**: Categorize toxic comments into different types (e.g., hate speech, personal attacks).
- **Natural Language Processing**: Use NLP techniques to preprocess and analyze text data.
- **Deep Learning**: Leverage advanced deep learning models for high accuracy in detection and classification.
